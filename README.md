# Chess
Luka Markovic and Dejan Livada

This is a project made using both C/C++ and Python.

Python is the frontend of the project, with displaying chess pieces, taking user input, and sending the boardState to the C++ DLL, which tells it possible moves, and the best move to play.

Before making a bot for chess, this chess was playable multiplayer, via socket, and two player on one device.

ISSUES:
    1. En passant, and castling does not work ( not added )
    2. Promotion does not work ( not added)
    3. Recently found a weird one about a king eating his own pawn?
